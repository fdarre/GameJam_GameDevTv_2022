Feathers

Feathers has been developped as part of the GameDevTV GameJam 2022.

The player is dead and the purpose of the game is to assemble a pair of wings to be able to reach the afterlife by collecting 10 feathers throughout 3 levels.

The player can shoot a star to make ghosts disappear (after 3 hits) and jump to avoid traps.

The player will turn into a ghost after being hurt 3 times.

Assets, musics, sounds and fonts have been downloaded from Unity asset store, freesounds and Google fonts. Only free assets have been used.
